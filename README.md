Hello everybody! My name is Dorje (door-jay), I am 22 years old, and I am a Computer Science major
at Orange Coast College. I have been at OCC for one semester and a summer and I am looking to eventually
transfer to a UC, ideally UC Berkeley or UCI to earn my Bachelor's Degree (maybe master's). 
I currently know the basics of Java and python but C++ is th elanguage I am most comfortable in.
This semester I am taking Data Structures in C++ which seems like it'll be a blast to be in!
Wish me luck!
