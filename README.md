Hello everybody! My name is Dorje (door-jay), I am 22 years old, and I am a Computer Science major
at Orange Coast College. I have been at OCC for one semester and a summer and I am looking to eventually
transfer to a UC, although Stanford is the dream, to earn my Bachelor's Degree (maybe master's). 
I currently know the basics of Java and C++ however, this semester I am taking Python 1 and C++ 2!
Wish me luck!
